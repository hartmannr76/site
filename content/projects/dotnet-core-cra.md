So I was reading this post a while ago on [wiring up a server-side-rendering pipeline into the Create React Application](https://medium.com/bucharestjs/upgrading-a-create-react-app-project-to-a-ssr-code-splitting-setup-9da57df2040a) and decided to try this myself, but in a language/framework that I like for server side programming (no offense JavaScript).

I ended up getting something that worked pretty well and will probably explain it more in detail at some point in time.
